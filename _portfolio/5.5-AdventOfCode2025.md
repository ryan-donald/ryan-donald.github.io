I have my solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 challenges within this [repo](https://github.com/ryan-donald/advent_of_code_2025). I find that these challenges are a fun set of tasks every year as they are all christmas themed, and within the spirit of the season. Some of the challenges are also uniquely challenging as they require a different type of solution than I typically solve with code, which leads me to learn new tools.
