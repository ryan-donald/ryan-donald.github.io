In a group of four students, for our undergraduate capstone, we were tasked with reviewing and updating the electrical infrastructure of an existing underwater robot which had not been operable for a number of years. To do this, we first investigated and cataloged the existing infrastructure of the robot, and created a plan for replacing various components for performance, safety, or specification requirements. As a result of our successful execution of the plan, the robot was now functional. Additionally, replacing the computer with a raspberry pi allowed the robot to utilize ROS, an open source robot middleware, which allows for future modification to improve functionality. Due to scheduling and timing constraints, we were only able to test the robot on land.
