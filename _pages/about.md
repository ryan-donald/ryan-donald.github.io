I am a driven engineer, who is passionate about writing code for robots that allows them to solve hard problems. In addition to this, I enjoy expanding my knowledge by learning as much as I possibly can. I began to develop a passion for robotics when I was in high school, as I competed on my school's VEX robotics team. Our team made it to the regional tournament multiple years, where I was able to compete with other teams and see how different robots can be designed to solve the same problem. From here, I joined a robotics research lab at University of Massachusetts, Lowell, the Persistent Autonomy and Robot Learning (PeARL) lab, at the start of my sophomore year of my undergraduate degree. I worked in this lab as a research assistant continuously through my Master's degree, for a total of four years. While at this lab, I developed a passion for writing code for robots, where I could see the robot solving a problem in simulation, and then in the real-world.  
  
I pride myself on being a fast learner and a hard worker, who has an unending desire to expand my knowledge. Additionally, I enjoy working in a team where I can collaborate with others and their unique perspectives to develop the best solution possible. I look forward to continue working in the robotics world, learning as much as I can, and making an impact to move this domain forward. 

<!--I am a driven engineer who is excited to learn and looks forward to improving my knowledge, while sharing with anyone I can along the way. I learned to love robotics starting in high school, where I was on my high school’s VEX robotics team.

I worked at this lab until I graduated with my Master’s, which was a total of four years.  While there, I was able to realize that I loved to work with and code for robots. I do my best to be easy to work with and try to make sure everyone I work with is involved.-->
