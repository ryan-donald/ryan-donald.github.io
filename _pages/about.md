I am a driven engineer, who is excited to learn and looks forward to improving my knowledge and helping anyone I can along the way. I learned to love robotics starting in high school, where I was on my high school’s VEX robotics team. From there, during my sophomore year of college, I began working in a robotics research lab at UMass Lowell, the Persistent Autonomy and Robot Learning (PeARL) lab. I worked at this lab until I graduated with my Master’s, which was a total of four years.  While there, I was able to realize that I loved to work with and code for robots. I do my best to be easy to work with and try to make sure everyone I work with is involved.
