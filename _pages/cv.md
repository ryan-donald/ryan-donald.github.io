Education
======
* M.S. in Computer Engineering. University of Massachusetts, Lowell. 2024. 4.0 GPA
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering. University of Massachusetts, Lowell. 2023. 3.95 GPA

Work experience
======
* **Member of Technical Staff 2**
  * **April 2025 - August 2025**
  * **Draper**
  * Responsible for design, implementation, and documentation of code on a micro controller.
  * Performed check-out and bring-up of a system alongside a senior engineer, including debugging of any issues.
  * Developed Python code for post-processing of test data.
  * Chose to leave to persure a career in robotics.
  
* **Research Assistant**
  * **September 2020 - August 2024**
  * **Persistent Autonomy and Robot Learning (PeARL) Lab at University of Massachusetts, Lowell**
  * Designed, developed, and implemented a framework for underwater inspection with a robot within simulation.
  * Developed a predictive framework utilizing a Intel Realsense camera, attached to the wrist of a Kinova Robotics Jaco 2, mounted on a Ghost Robotics Vision 60. This allows the system to predict and react to environment motion for better target tracking during and after execution of motions within a dynamic environment.
  * Developed test methods and evaluation frameworks for the categorization and measurement of the autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, from both a non-contextual and contextual standpoint.
  * Gained experience with multiple different different robots including a Fetch Robotics Mobile Manipulator, Kinova Robotics Jaco 2, Ghost Robotics Vision 60, Universal Robots UR5e, and Boston Dynamics Spot.

* **Grader**
  * **January 2023 - May 2023**
  * **University of Massachusetts, Lowell**
  * Provided students in the lab with feedback and guidance during COMP.4500 Mobile Robotics I.
  * Graded the performance of Student’s robots in each of 5 lab projects during the semester.
  * Worked with the Professor to effectively teach students the material.
  * Helped teach debugging and testing principles when student’s code or robots had issues.
